# Microvers Portfolio project

> This is my second project with microverse which we have to create a portfolio.

## Create A branch Called fetures 

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI.
- Flexbox to place elements in the page.
- Build a personal portfolio site.
- Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

# Description

For the first milestone in the process of creating your portfolio website, you will:

- set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters).
- build the first 2 sections of the mobile website using the template you chose in the previous step.

## General requirements
- Make sure that there are no linter errors:
   - Linter should be set up correctly for this repository.
   - Linter result should be green.
   - There should be no custom changes to linter config.
- Make sure that you used correct GitHub Flow:
   - README file should be descriptive.
   - Commit messages should be meaningful.
   - Pull Request should have a descriptive title explaining what changes are inside.
   - Pull Request should have a short summary describing introduced changes in more detail.
- Make sure that you documented your work in a professional way:
   - Branch name should describe a feature or action (e.g. 'created_sidebar' or 'added_comments_section').
   - Pull Request is made from 'feature branch' into the main branch.
- Explore all the Bootstrap components to see which ones you may need. For this exercise you don't need to personalize them to adjust to the design template. Here is a list of some components that could be useful:
   - navbar and nav for the header.
   - scrollspy to update the active menu link when the user scrolls.
   - cards for the list of portfolio projects.
   - buttons.
   - badges for the list of technologies.
   - modals for the popup window with the project details.
   - Bootstrap forms components to create the contact form.
   - the grid system to place elements inline with others.
