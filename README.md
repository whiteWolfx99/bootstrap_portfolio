## Learning Objectives

- Use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website.

# Description

For the first milestone in the process of creating your portfolio website, you will:

- set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters).
- build the first 2 sections of the mobile website using the template you chose in the previous step.

## General requirements
- Make sure that there are no linter errors:
   - Linter should be set up correctly for this repository.
   - Linter result should be green.
   - There should be no custom changes to linter config.
- Make sure that you used correct GitHub Flow:
   - README file should be descriptive.
   - Commit messages should be meaningful.
   - Pull Request should have a descriptive title explaining what changes are inside.
   - Pull Request should have a short summary describing introduced changes in more detail.
- Make sure that you documented your work in a professional way:
   - Branch name should describe a feature or action (e.g. 'created_sidebar' or 'added_comments_section').
   - Pull Request is made from 'feature branch' into the main branch.
